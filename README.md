**This is an unofficial program and is not officially endorsed by the Transcribers of Reddit nor the Grafeas Group; they are in no way involved with this program and are not liable for any matters relating to it. This is developed unofficially, in my capacity as a volunteer, NOT a moderator.**

**WARNING: use of this bot can cause the ToR-Stats Discord bot to freeze, if you have the bad luck to delete a comment while it is being processed.**

Nicknamed Oscar, this program removes blacklisted comments after a period of time. It is designed with r/TranscribersOfReddit transcribers in mind; specifically those who are tired of these comments clogging up their profiles, thus the contents of the default blacklist.

### OSCR's documentation is hosted at readthedocs, [see here](https://oscr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For emergency contact, I'm reachable through `murdo@maclachlans.org.uk` and `murdomaclachlan@gmail.com` (the first address is preferred). You can also open an issue on GitHub if needed.
