.. warning:: Use of this bot has been known to cause the **ToR-Stats Discord bot** to freeze, should you have the bad luck to delete a comment while it is being processed. Use at your own risk.

**This is an unofficial program. It is not officially endorsed by the Transcribers of Reddit or the Grafeas Group; they are in no way involved with or liable for this program or any matters relating to it. It is developed unofficially, in my capacity as a volunteer, NOT a moderator.**

The Open Source Caretaker for Reddit, abbreviated OSCR and nicknamed Oscar, is a program that removes blacklisted comments from a user's Reddit profile once the comment is older than a cutoff time. It is designed with `r/TranscribersOfReddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit>`_ volunteers in mind, thus the contents of the default blacklist and other certain functionalities that help limit it to this use.

If set to recur, the program will delete new blacklisted comments periodically as they move past the cutoff time.
